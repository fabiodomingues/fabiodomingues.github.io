[{"content":"Hello World!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried to start this blog other times, but it never got good enough and I soon gave up. I\u0026rsquo;m very critical of myself and I charge myself a lot for the quality of the things I do. And that made me procrastinate on this project for a few years, and this time I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with the basics and continually improve.\nBeing here today talking about this has 3 motivators that I will talk a little about each one.\nMy career I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with software for over 15 years and I\u0026rsquo;m seen as a reference by the people who know me and the companies I\u0026rsquo;ve worked for. So I think I have a lot of cool things to share, make public, and that will help a lot in my career and professional growth and also for those who will follow me here.\nLearn in public Recently I heard about learn in public, and it caught my attention, to the point of wanting to try it. Reading a little more about it, I realized that I don\u0026rsquo;t just need to share what I know, but also what I\u0026rsquo;m learning at the moment, no matter how simple or small the content may be.\nAt work I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid of making mistakes, I\u0026rsquo;m in a safe environment, the number of people is smaller, but writing on a personal blog that will be accessible to everyone on the internet surprises me.\nI intend to soon make a post just on the topic of learn in public.\nInspiration I have been following my friend Leandro Boeing Vieira (we work together at Softplan) who is writing the book \u0026ldquo;Minha Jornada para Ganhar em DÃ³lar como Programador\u0026rdquo; (in English: my Journey to earn dollars as a programmer) and has shared each step on his LinkedIn and Instagram, with the purpose of sharing with people the practices, techniques and soft skills that were necessary to earn dollars as a programmer working in Brazil for an American company (today he is living in the United States).\nThis whole journey, of mistakes and learnings that he has been sharing publicly, and the chats that we have inspired me. And in every interaction we have, he always finds an opportunity to remind me that my knowledge is worth sharing.\nSo thanks \u0026ldquo;Lep\u0026rdquo; for the inspiration!\nAnyway, this first post is to launch my personal blog, and also share this new journey. I feel like it won\u0026rsquo;t be easy, I\u0026rsquo;m sweating writing this simple blog launch post, but I\u0026rsquo;ll stay consistent until it becomes natural.\nI\u0026rsquo;m open to receiving feedback, so feel free to contact me :)\n","permalink":"https://fabiodomingues.com/en/posts/the-first-post/","summary":"Hello World!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried to start this blog other times, but it never got good enough and I soon gave up.
