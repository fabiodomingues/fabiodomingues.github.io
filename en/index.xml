      <description>Hello World!
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to start this blog other times, but it never got good enough and I soon gave up. I&amp;rsquo;m very critical of myself and I charge myself a lot for the quality of the things I do. And that made me procrastinate on this project for a few years, and this time I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with the basics and continually improve.
Being here today talking about this has 3 motivators that I will talk a little about each one.</description>
